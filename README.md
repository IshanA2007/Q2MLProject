Running the code in this github is very simple. First clone this repository, and then access the code folder. You can open any of the three python files in your favorite IDE, and then simply click the run button in the top right corner. The knn.py is the main file that runs and tests all the KNN models. The smoteing.py file runs the SMOTE preprocessing technique, and the create_dataset.py file creates the dataset that the other two files will use.
